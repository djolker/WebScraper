# WebScraper
A web scraper I've been working on in free time

#Note
I'm pretty new to Java at this point so I'm sure there are plenty of problems in some of the formatting.

Most noteably is the naming of the package.  After messing around with creating projects in various IDE's, I started
naming various copies of the project based on which IDE I was using to work on them, as going from one to the other
without rebuilding some of the project data never worked for me. Last one I tried was Netbeans. I'll fix this 
eventually.
